# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains the solutions to the problems I solve on LeetCode. By organizing my solutions here, I aim to strengthen my problem-solving skills, improve my algorithmic knowledge, and track my progress as I work through various challenges.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is:
- To provide a collection of solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems.
- To practice and level up my skills in data structures, algorithms, and coding interview preparation.
- To revisit and optimize my solutions over time as I learn and grow as a developer.

## Solution Approach
Each solution includes:
- The problem statement.
- A clean, commented solution in Python and C#.
- A brief explanation of the approach taken to solve the problem.
- Time and space complexity analysis for each solution.
